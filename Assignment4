This assigment will cover the synchronization.

1>> Using the shared memory IPC try to see race condition. Have one
    shared structure. Modify that in two different process.

2>> From Que.1 after seeing Race condition, Try to implement a synchronizaion
    techique. Here try to achive above using binary semaphore.
    Now after implement binary semaphore share your observation on the O/P.

3>> In the above case when one process have taken the semphore what will haven to the
    other process if it tries to take semaphore. Refer to ps or top to verify your
    learning about synchronization.

4>> Implement one example of counting semaphore. What difference you see between counting
    and binary semaphore.
