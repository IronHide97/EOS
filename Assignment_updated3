>> In this assignment we will be implementing IPC like
message-queue, pipe, shared-memory, signals and socket.

>>1 Create a program, have 2 child created from the parent
    process and establish pipe ipc between 2 childs.

>>2 In the above question extend the program to have pipe to 
    have bi-directional communication.

>>3 Write a program to implement named-pipe IPC/FIFO between two
    unrelated process.

>>4 Write a program to implement the message-queue IPC.

>>5 Extend the above question to have M-que IPC with two
    unrelated program.

>>6 Write a prgram to implement Shared memory IPC between 2
    processes.

>>7 Write a program to implement signals IPC.

>>8 Write a program to implement socket IPC between two process
    having server and client relation.
